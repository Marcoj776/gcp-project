# Motivation

Ever since I wrote my first line of code I knew I wanted to own my own piece of the internet.
This repo contains all of my source code for my development site (marcojones.dev)[https://marcojones.dev/].
I use this site as a dry dock for web development mainly for friends and hopefully paid someday outside of my full-time job.

## Future projects

Cooking blog for a friend
Web3.js app
Magento Web3.js integration for connecting to Web3 wallets like Metamask - will be on another repo

## Credits

This project was helped by libraries such as React, Materials-UI and their helpful free demos
